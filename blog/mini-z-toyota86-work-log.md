 After purchasing a Futaba 10PX, I decided to purchase a Kyosho MA-030EVO2 kit to quietly play around with at home for drifting.
 
 The problem is that this kit only includes the basic chassis, without the receiver, tires, etc.
 
 I was able to easily purchase the receiver, tires, and wheels, and even successfully bound them, but... the problem is the body!!
 
 Most major online RC shops in Korea are completely sold out of painted bodies for the MA-020!!! ㅠㅠ;
 
 So, I ended up buying an unpainted Toyota 86 body, and while searching, I discovered that a wide-body kit existed!!! Wow, I was so captivated by the purchase that I initially thought I'd just buy it, assemble it roughly, and have fun with it quickly. That's how this article began.

As you can see in the picture, the wheels and tires don't match...

Anyway, back to the main point. First, I learned that the MA-030EVO2 chassis is compatible with the MA-020 chassis body. I started searching for a suitable body, but there weren't many compatible options. I didn't even like any of them.

The MA-020 Body available in Korea is as follows.

All of them are Body Styles that I hate... I liked Toyota 86... but they don't sell finished bodies!!! ㅠㅠ; In the end, I decided to buy a Toyota 86 body and paint it!!!

While researching, I found out that they also sell a wide body option in resin, so I decided to paint both bodies at the same time!!!

The WIDE Body Option Part is sold by a Hong Kong company called "HRC Mini-Z Arena," which produces small quantities through injection molding. The image of the sales site is shown below.

Okay, let's get started. First, we'll be working on two units. One will be fitted with a wide kit, and the other will be standard. Let's get started!

1. Wide body machining (injection + resin)
   
   - This is my first time working on a resin kit using molding on an injection kit, and since I lacked information, I looked up examples on the web and started working on it on my own.

   -After looking at assembly examples online, I found that resin kits require step and shape correction during injection and assembly. So, I washed the resin kit with a neutral detergent and soaked it in slightly hot water to correct the shape and steps.

   - The resin kit was impossible to bond with regular plastic adhesives, so I needed an instant adhesive, so I used Loctite 401.

![와이드바디_가공](image/가공03.jpg)
![와이드바디_가공](image/가공04.jpg)
![와이드바디_가공](image/가공05.jpg)

As expected? Steps, gaps, bubbles!!! Ah~ This is dizzying...

Anyway, after gluing, I tried to match it with the Chassis. (This is a necessary step to check for interference with the Chassis!!)

And I didn't like the wide fender that was sticking out to the side, so I sanded it down to make it look like an integrated piece.

2. Surfacer work

   - After the body processing work was completed to a certain extent, the panel lines were newly carved. (This is to prevent the panel lines from being accidentally buried and not being able to be painted when going through the surfacer->base color->main paint->clear process.)

   -Next, I'll add a surfacer. For the body, which contains resin, a special surfacer is needed. This is called a primer! Fortunately, Gunze sells a product that mixes primer and surfacer.

   ![surfacer](image/surfacer01.jpg)


   -But as expected~ a surfacer is a surfacer!! The steps and pores that are revealed after spraying!!

![서페이서](image/서페이서03.jpg)
![서페이서](image/서페이서04.jpg)

   - Correct it with putty first!!! (I realized this after finishing the work, but... I think the secret to fixing resin joints and steps is instant adhesive..)

![서페이서](image/서페이서5-03.jpg)
![서페이서](image/서페이서5-04.jpg)

   -After endless repetition of putty -> sandpaper -> sandpaper, I finally got some results!!!

3. Painting work

   -After that, small bubbles and gaps were found, so I repeated the same process endlessly, applied white surfacer, and finally applied the main paint. (The paint used for the main paint was IPP fluorescent yellow)
   ![본도료](image/IPP형광옐로우.jpg)

   -I worked on the wide body first.

![본도장](image1/본도장05.jpg)
![본도장](image1/본도장06.jpg)
![본도장](image1/본도장10.jpg)

   -Next is the standard build version (since there are no specific modification points for the standard build version, I only refined the panel lines, and after working on the surfacer with the gunze surfacer 1000, I put on a white surfacer.)

   - As a bonus, comparison shots of the widebody and standard body, and a chassis fit shot of the standard body.

![본도장](image1/본도장12.jpg)

   - Next, I finished the main painting with a glossy black paint on the bonnet, rooftop, and lip parts that will be the base for the carbon decals. (The part I regret looking at the pictures is the black treatment on the molding parts. I cut the masking tape into small pieces and worked on it, but I ruined it... Next time, I'll have to stick one large piece and cut it with an art knife. ㅠㅠ)

  -This time, the standard body

  -The headlights were painted in the following order: gloss black -> clear -> chrome silver.

4. Decal work

   -I was looking through my phone's photos to upload photos of the decal work...but I didn't take any photos except for the carbon decal!!!! 

   -First...the standard body...

![본도장](image1/데칼01.jpg)

   -Next is wide body....

![본도장](image1/데칼02.jpg)

   -Comparison shot

   -I'm uploading a photo of the decal I applied before opening it.

5. Clearing work

   Clear is a must for all finishes!! First, create a clear layer to eliminate decal gaps. (The clear used is IPP Super Clear/Leveling Thinner.)

   - First, wide body

![본도장](image2/클리어02.jpg)
![본도장](image2/클리어03.jpg)
![본도장](image2/클리어04.jpg)
![본도장](image2/클리어05.jpg)
![본도장](image2/클리어06.jpg)

   -Next is the standard body

![본도장](image2/클리어07.jpg)
![본도장](image2/클리어08.jpg)
![본도장](image2/클리어09.jpg)
![본도장](image2/클리어10.jpg)
![본도장](image2/클리어11.jpg)

   -After drying for about 2-3 days, remove any gaps in the decal with 2000-grit sandpaper, then apply a second clear coat.

   -Wide body

![본도장](image2/클리어14.jpg)
![본도장](image2/클리어15.jpg)
![본도장](image2/클리어16.jpg)

   -Standard body

![본도장](image2/클리어17.jpg)
![본도장](image2/클리어18.jpg)
![본도장](image2/클리어19.jpg)
![본도장](image2/클리어20.jpg)
![본도장](image2/클리어21.jpg)

   -After curing for another 2-3 days, check and correct the condition and gaps of the final decals, and apply the final clear coat. (I just found out that IPP Super Clear + Leveling Thinner doesn't produce orange peel, but it takes an incredibly long time to cure... of course, not as much as urethane. lol)

   -Wide body

![본도장](image2/클리어26.jpg)

   -Standard body

![본도장](image2/클리어24.jpg)

6. Polishing work

   -Now it's time to see the results. The process involves smoothing the clear layer with 2000-grit sandpaper and then mindlessly rubbing it with compound.

   -However, the glass window included in the body kit had many scratches, so I worked on that as well.

   -First, work on the glass window

![본도장](image2/폴리싱01.jpg)

![본도장](image2/폴리싱02.jpg)
![본도장](image2/폴리싱03.jpg)

   -And body polishing work!!!

   -This is a photo after sanding first and then using a rough compound.

![본도장](image2/폴리싱05.jpg)

   -Next is the finishing grade polishing work!!

   -Wide body

   -Standard body comparison shot

![본도장](image2/폴리싱07.jpg)


7. Assembly

   -This part was also not filmed due to the creator's lazy nature. Only photos of the standard body work exist.

   -Nothing special, just assembling this and that.

8. Wiring

   -I decided to organize the messy wires because I didn't like the look of them since I applied LEDs.

   - I made it myself by cutting a 1mm thick plastic plate and glued it using both regular glue and instant adhesive for plastic.

![본도장](image2/배선04.jpg)

9. Final work

   - Assembly is complete and final waxing is done.
   
   It took about a month to complete, mostly due to drying time for the paint and clear coat. For a road-going car paint job, the quality was so good that it was a real shame to install it and drive it.

**There is a caution!!!**
-It is recommended to leave it for a certain period of time even after completion until the clear is completely hardened.
-Otherwise, if you store it incorrectly, a disaster like the one in the photo below will occur. Hahaha
